        <p>Hello friends and family!</p>
        <p>
          Thank you for visiting our registry page. Please know that the greatest gift you could
          give us would be your attendance to our wedding and sharing time with us!
        </p>
        <p>
          We live in a cozy little house in East Austin and don't have space for too many things.
          Although we have a few traditional gifts on our registry and some household upgrades,
          we decided to make our honeymoon, kick starting our new married life, and a few
          charities the focal point of our registry. If you'd like, please help send us along
          on a memorable trip to Croatia by contributin to some of our honeymoon cash gift experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you so much for keeping us in your minds and hearts. We're so grateful for all of you!
